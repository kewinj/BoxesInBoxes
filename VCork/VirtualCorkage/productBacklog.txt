Sprint 1: 3rd Nov 2010 to 7th Nov 2010
======================================

As a user, I want to zoom and pan the corkboard
[JK]/	Sort out problem with capture mouse on corkboard (make corkboard a control?) 
[JK]/	Allow user to adjust easing functions & timings via xaml (dep. properties)
[JK]/	Try and get the full size corkboard shown (so that its not clipped but always the same size)
	
		
As a user, I want to add a story to the corkboard
[JK]/	Add story to the task board (kinda already done)
[JK]/	Put an image on the background of the story (5x3 card?)
[JK]/	Stop user from adding too many stories? Could put a limit on it for now (set max# stories on corkboard?)
[JK]	Allow user to adjust text on story card (don't bother with story points)
	Stop user from typing in too much text

	
	
	
As a user, I want to add a task to the corkboard
	Prevent user from adding too many tasks (cat1 error) (eventually this should be a resize)
	Put an image on the background of a task (piece of paper?)
	Prevent user from adding too much text to task
	Allow user to move tasks around
